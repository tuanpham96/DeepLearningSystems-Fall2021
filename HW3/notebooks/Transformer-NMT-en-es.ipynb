(2017)). This paper was a more advanced step in the use of the attention mechanism being the main basis for a model called Transformer. The most famous current models that are emerging in NLP tasks consist of dozens of transformers or some of their variants, for example, GPT-3 or BERT.\n","\n","Attention is all you need: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf\n","\n","We will describe the components of this model, analyze their operation and build a simple model that we will apply to a small-scale NMT problem (Neural Machine Translation). To read more about the problem that we will address and to know how the basic attention mechanism works, I recommend you to read my previous  post [ \"A Guide on the Encoder-Decoder Model and the Attention Mechanism\"](https://medium.com/better-programming/a-guide-on-the-encoder-decoder-model-and-the-attention-mechanism-401c836e2cdb) and check the [ repository](https://github.com/edumunozsala/NMT-encoder-decoder-Attention)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"822Yvg8KVyR9"},"source":["![Alt](https://github.com/edumunozsala/Transformer-NMT/blob/main/images/transformer.jpg)\n","\n","## Why we need Transformer?\n","\n","In sequence-to-sequence treatment problems such as the neural machine translation, the initial proposals were based on the use of RNNs in an encoder-decoder architecture. These architectures presented a great limitation when working with long sequences, their ability to retain information from the first elements was lost when new elements were incorporated into the sequence. In the encoder, the hidden state in every step is associated with a certain word in the input sentence, the more recent. Therefore, if the decoder only accesses the last hidden state of the decoder, it will lose relevant information about the first elements of the sequence. Then to deal with this limitation, a new concept were introduced **the attention mechanism**.\n","\n","Instead of paying attention to the last state of the encoder as is usually done with the RNNs, in each step of the decoder we look at all the states of the encoder, being able to access information about all the elements of the input sequence. This is what attention does, it extracts information from the whole sequence, a weighted sum of all the past encoder states. This allows the decoder to assign greater weight or importance to a certain element of the input for each element of the output. Learning in every step to focus in the right element of the input to predict the next output element.\n","\n","But this approach continues to have an important limitation, each sequence must be treated one at a time. Both the encoder and the decoder have to wait till the completion of t-1 steps to process at 't'th step. So when dealing with huge corpus **it is very time consuming and computationally inefficient**."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fN7pJARIt9uK"},"source":["# Loading the libraries"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"t5DbIHC-F6Hf"},"source":["Load and install, if necessary, the python libraries we will use along this notebook.
