#Anything in this file, followed by a period (and an upper-case word), does NOT indicate an end-of-sentence marker.
#Special cases are included for prefixes that ONLY appear before 0-9 numbers.
#Though in Vietnamese, nonbreaking prefixes aren't very common, the only thing I can think of is abbreviations
#Some vowels followed by a period/question mark could signify ending: Ê Ô Ơ Ư
