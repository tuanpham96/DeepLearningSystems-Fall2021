Because Colab needed attending to, the models were run on Kaggle GPU instead, the resulting notebooks are in [`notebooks/kaggle-notebooks/`](notebooks/kaggle-notebooks/). The results containing the losses and accuracies are saved and downloaded to [`output`](output). No checkpoints are downloaded in this repository as they are too big.

Model 10 (reduce vocab size) was not the right implementation when run, so run again after update.
